# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
**Project Overview**

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of customer shopping behavior using transactional retail data. The goal is to generate actionable insights into customer spending patterns, product performance, subscription behavior, and customer segmentation to support data-driven business decisions.

The analysis was carried out using Python for data cleaning and preparation, SQL for structured querying, and Power BI for visualization and reporting.


**Dataset Description**

Records: 3,900 customer purchase transactions

Features: 18 variables including:

Customer demographics (age, gender, location, subscription status)

Purchase details (product category, item purchased, amount, season, size, color)

Shopping behavior (discount usage, purchase frequency, review ratings, shipping type)

Missing values were identified during exploratory analysis and treated appropriately during preprocessing.


**Tools and Technologies**

Python (Pandas): Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering

MySQL/SQL: Data querying and business analysis

Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard development


**Key Analysis Questions**

How does revenue vary by gender and age group?

Do customers who use discounts still contribute significantly to revenue?

Which products are the most purchased and highest rated?

How does spending differ between subscribers and non-subscribers?

Are repeat buyers more likely to subscribe?

Which products are highly dependent on discounts?

How can customers be segmented based on purchase history?


**Key Insights**

A small number of customer segments contribute a significant share of total revenue.

High-value customers can still be identified among discount users.

Repeat and loyal customers show a stronger tendency to subscribe.

Some products are heavily reliant on discounts, which may impact long-term profitability.

Certain age groups and shipping preferences are associated with higher revenue contribution.


**Dashboard**

An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize:

Revenue trends

Customer segmentation

Product performance

Subscription behavior

The dashboard file is included in the repository.


**Business Recommendations**

Strengthen subscription incentives to increase recurring revenue.

Implement loyalty programs to retain high-value repeat customers.

Review and optimize discount strategies to balance sales growth and profitability.

Promote top-rated and best-selling products through targeted campaigns.

Focus marketing efforts on high-revenue customer segments.
